This article explains how RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) addresses that problem by grounding AI responses in verified source material, essentially giving the chatbot footnotes to cite. It also outlines Four Kitchens' proven development process for chatbot projects: starting with discovery to validate that AI is the right tool, moving through design and architecture, prompt engineering, two cycles of testing (internal and adversarial "red teaming"), and finally public deployment with ongoing monitoring.
