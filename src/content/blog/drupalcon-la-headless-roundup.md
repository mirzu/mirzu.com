With headless Drupal gaining serious momentum, this article rounded up the must-see sessions at DrupalCon LA covering decoupled architecture. Highlights included talks on when, why, and how to decouple Drupal (from Pantheon and Gizra), Four Kitchens' own David Diers presenting API design best practices in a musical format, a fascinating government case study on using headless Drupal for a crowdsourced contraband reporting app, and sessions on Angular.js with Drupal 8 and the future of HTML rendering in Drupal. The article also noted that Four Kitchens' Introduction to Headless Drupal training sold out in record time.
