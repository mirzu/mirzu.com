  Lets face it: the primary audience of anything being published on the web is robots, and humans are soon to be second class citizens.

# Robots First Web

Two recent articles highlight what an groundbreaking change there is happening on the web.

## **The Web Is Becoming Robot-First (And That Changes Everything)**

Two recent articles stopped me in my tracks.

One, from Boye & Company, lays out the implications of what they call the _robot-first web_. The other, Dries Buytaert’s essay on _the third audience_, reframes how we should think about who the web is actually for now. Read together, they describe a shift so fundamental it rivals the arrival of search engines or the rise of social media.

As one line put it perfectly:

> “The Web is experiencing its most significant transformation since its beginning in the 1990s, shifting from human-centric design to a ‘robot-first’ approach where AI systems are becoming primary consumers of web content.”

That sounds dramatic. It is. And most organizations are wildly underestimating what it means.

## **A Short History of the Web’s Audiences**

The web has always had an audience, but that audience has changed over time.

**First, it was humans.**

Early websites were built for people who clicked links, read pages top to bottom, and navigated intentionally. Information architecture mattered because humans needed it to make sense of what they were seeing.

**Then came search engines.**

Google and its peers became an important secondary audience. Website owners learned to care about crawlability, metadata, and rankings, but humans were still the end destination. Search engines were guides, not replacements.

**Now comes the third audience: AI systems.**

Large language models, agents, and assistants increasingly consume your content directly and then answer questions _without sending users to your site at all_.

Your website is no longer just a destination. It’s a data source.

And that changes everything.

---

## **Your Users May Never Visit Your Site Again**

This is the part that feels hardest to internalize.

People are increasingly getting answers from AI tools instead of traditional search results. When that happens, your content may be summarized, synthesized, or quoted without a single pageview. No homepage. No navigation. No carefully designed CTA.

That does not mean your website matters less.

It means your website’s _clarity, structure, and machine readability_ matter more than ever.

Organizations that assume “if we don’t get traffic, the web is dead” are missing the point. The real competition now is whether your information is:

- Findable by AI systems
- Understandable out of context
- Trustworthy enough to be used as a source

If it isn’t, something else will happily take its place.

## **Robot-First Is an Opportunity, Not Just a Threat**

There’s a tendency to hear all of this as bad news. It isn’t.

This shift creates a rare opportunity for organizations that move early. If your site is easy for AI systems to consume and understand, you can leapfrog competitors who are still optimizing for yesterday’s web.

In a robot-first world, relevance beats reach.

Clear beats clever.

Structure beats spectacle.

And that favors organizations willing to invest in fundamentals.

## **What Actually Matters in a Robot-First Web**

Best practices are evolving quickly, but some themes are already emerging as durable truths.

### **Accessibility and performance are no longer “nice to have”**

Fast pages, clean markup, and accessible content help humans, search engines, and AI systems equally. The same things that make a site usable also make it legible to machines.

### **Structured content is everything**

Clear hierarchy, meaningful headings, metadata, and consistent content models are no longer internal niceties. They are how AI systems understand relationships between ideas.

If your content only makes sense visually, it will fail here.

### **Simplicity wins**

Dense marketing language, unclear ownership of ideas, and sprawling pages with no clear focus are liabilities. AI systems reward specificity and clarity, not vibes.

### **Simpler technology helps more than you think**

Overly complex front ends, fragile JavaScript dependencies, and unnecessary abstraction layers make it harder for crawlers and agents to reliably access your content.

Boring technology, well implemented, is having a moment.

### **Markdown is quietly resurging**

Plain, structured, portable content formats are suddenly attractive again. Markdown is easy to parse, easy to transform, and easy to reuse. That combination matters in a world where content is constantly being reinterpreted by machines.

## **New Protocols Are Arriving Fast**

We are also seeing early signals of what the next layer of the web looks like:

- Agent-oriented protocols like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Google experimenting with agentic commerce and purchasing flows
- Emerging conventions like llms.txt to guide AI systems intentionally

None of these are fully settled standards yet. That’s the point. When infrastructure starts shifting, it moves unevenly and quickly. Waiting for “the winner” usually means arriving late.

---

## **Own Your Information Or Lose Control of It**

One of the quiet dangers of this transition is how much power shifts to platforms and intermediaries.

If your authoritative content only lives inside social media, SaaS platforms, or walled gardens, you are trusting third parties to represent you accurately in an AI-mediated world. That is a risky bet.

Publishing clearly, directly, and openly on your own site gives you the best chance of being understood correctly. If you don’t provide clean, accessible answers, someone else will provide them _about_ you.

Often incorrectly.

## **The Web Isn’t Ending. It’s Rewriting Its Rules.**

No one can say exactly what the web will look like in five years. Anyone who claims certainty is selling something.

What _is_ clear is this: the shift to a robot-first web is already underway, and it is not optional.

For organizations that care about being seen, heard, and trusted, paying attention to their web presence has never been more important. Not as a marketing asset, but as infrastructure. As knowledge. As truth.

It’s going to be a wild ride.

But the organizations that slow down, simplify, and design for understanding instead of attention are going to do just fine.

## **Humans Still Matter (Just Not Always First)**

It’s important to be very clear about one thing:

**robot-first does not mean human-last.**

Even if AI systems increasingly act as intermediaries, humans are still the ones making decisions, forming trust, and acting on the information they receive. A site that works brilliantly for machines but poorly for people will fail in more subtle but equally damaging ways.

Humans still:

- Verify answers when stakes are high
- Decide whether an organization feels credible
- Look for nuance, context, and values
- Become customers, donors, students, voters, or advocates

In many cases, AI will be the _introduction_, not the relationship.

This creates a new design tension. Content must be structured enough for machines to interpret accurately, while still being humane, legible, and welcoming to real people who arrive later. Clarity helps both. Accessibility helps both. Honest, well-written content helps both.

The mistake organizations can make here is overcorrecting. Stripping away narrative, tone, and empathy in pursuit of machine readability risks creating experiences that feel sterile, transactional, or untrustworthy to humans.

The goal isn’t to choose between audiences.

It’s to recognize that **machines increasingly come first, but humans still decide what matters.**

The best sites going forward will respect both.

# Notes

Tom said it best: “The Web is experiencing its most significant transformation since its beginning in the 1990s, shifting from human-centric design to a "robot-first" approach where AI systems are becoming primary consumers of web content.“

The magnitude of this change is hard to fathom, but organizations need to pay attention and make their website is ready for the future that has already arrived. Everything from how users get information from your site, how content is written and perhaps most drastically how the performance is measures is changing very rapidly.

- The web was first built for humans to share information
- Then search engines came around and it became important for website owners to cater to their needs, but they were always a secondary audience.
- Then came the AI bots and suddenly your websites information is likely to get to users who never visit your site. (insert statics on growing use of AI for getting answers over traditional search)
- Organizations have an opportunity to get ahead of their competitors by making their sites easy for AI to consume and understand can leap frog their competion and become more relevant for answers.
- It’s more important than ever for organizations to pay attention to their web presence and make sure that their content is ready.
- Best practices are quickly evolving, but there are some things that are coming out as important
  - Fundamentals like accessibility and page load times are more important than ever
  - Structured content is more important than ever, metadata, good content hiearchy and clear writing
  - Simplify content and make relationships clear
  - Simplify technology to make it easier for crawlers to access
  - markdown is a thing (link to article about how markdown is having a moment)
- New protocols like Anthropic’s MCP, Google’s new agentic buying platform, and llms.txt are quickly coming onto the scene, and there are likely more on the horizon.
- it’s more important then ever to publish content outside walled gardens like social media, and for organizations to take make sure that what their users, or potential customers can get relevant and right information from them directly, or risk being overshadowed by information that is easier to find about them.
- It’s going to be a wild ride and it’s hard to pin down what exactly the web looks like, but it’s more important than ever that anyone who wants to be seen and heard in this new world adapt and pay attention.
