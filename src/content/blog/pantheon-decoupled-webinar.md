I recently joined Pantheon's Josh Koenig to discuss Four Kitchens' use of decoupled CMS architecture on projects like twit.com. The business case was compelling: clients get stellar cross-device experiences today, lower redesign costs tomorrow, and the ability to enable third-party developers to build on their content through JSON REST APIs.

Internally, our teams moved faster by working independently once we established clear API contracts - frontend developers could use design-in-browser techniques while backend teams focused on content structure. The trade-offs are real (you lose some CMS "freebies" like content previews), but the gains in agility, developer happiness, and client satisfaction made it worthwhile. We're contributing our methods back through open source tools like Saucier because we believe this architecture represents the future of web development.
