I’ve spoken at conferences throughout my career on topics spanning online publishing, Drupal, leadership, and artificial intelligence. Over the years, I’ve presented at multiple DrupalCons, DrupalCamps, and a range of other industry events.

Featured below is a talk I gave at Yale University during the early days of AI adoption in digital publishing.
