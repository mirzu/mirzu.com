As a fully remote company, Four Kitchens' team members only see each other's workspaces through webcam windows — so they built a WebVR experience that let people actually explore those spaces. Using A-Frame (a framework that makes creating VR scenes almost as simple as editing HTML), along with React, Webpack, and 360° photography, the team put together an immersive demo in just a few weeks. The biggest challenge wasn't the technology — it was storytelling in a medium where the viewer can look in every direction, requiring the team to think beyond traditional one-directional visual narrative. The demo was a hit at DrupalCon, and the team continued developing tools to make WebVR content creation accessible through Drupal.
