As an engineering manager, I prided myself on something specific: not being the bridge between business and engineering, but building my team up to do that work themselves. My goal was to make myself unnecessary as a translator. When I began leading cross-functional teams, I carried that philosophy across departments—building teams that understood each other, did their best individual work, and collaborated seamlessly.

I've tried to distill what I've learned down to most basic principles and best I can see there are 3 pillars, that are at the foundation of building effective teams. For the sake of alliteration, I've organized my philosophy around three E's: Excellence, Empowerment, and Empathy.

## Excellence: Building a Culture of Quality

**Excellence means creating an environment where quality and delivering value are intrinsically motivated.**

You can't mandate excellence. You can't policy your way into a team that cares deeply about their craft. What you can do is create the conditions where excellence becomes the natural standard.

Here's how I approach it:

**Lead by example.** Set a high bar for your own deliverables and how you show up. Your team watches everything you do—the quality of your presentations, how you communicate in meetings, whether you follow through on commitments. If you accept mediocrity from yourself, they'll accept it too.

**Hire for craft.** Look for people who show dedication to understanding problems deeply, not just solving them quickly. In interviews, I look for curiosity, for people who ask "why" multiple times, who want to understand the system, not just patch the symptom.

**Make hard decisions.** Fire people who consistently don't meet the responsibilities of their role. This sounds harsh, but keeping underperformers on the team is unfair to everyone—to them, because they're in the wrong role, and to the team, because it signals that mediocrity is acceptable.

**Promote peer review and collaboration.** Discourage "throwing things over the wall." When team members review each other's work and discuss approaches together, quality becomes everyone's responsibility, not just management's concern.

## Empowerment: Giving Teams Agency

**Empowerment means giving individuals and teams the agency to do their best work.**

Micromanagement kills motivation. It also doesn't scale. The best teams I've built are the ones where people have the confidence to make their own decisions, take calculated risks, and own their outcomes.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

**Build confidence through trust.** Give people real authority over their domains. Let them make decisions and occasionally fail. When they do fail, focus on learning, not blame. Nothing builds confidence like knowing your leader has your back.

**Process should enable, not constrain.** Build processes around the things that help teams focus on impactful work and avoid bikeshedding. Good process eliminates unnecessary decisions and creates space for meaningful ones. Bad process creates bureaucracy that slows everyone down.

**Define clear roles and responsibilities.** Ambiguity creates conflict. When people don't know who owns what, they either step on each other's toes or wait for someone else to act. Clear ownership means people can move fast without constantly checking if they're allowed to.

## Empathy: Creating Understanding and Trust

**Empathy means creating an environment of trust and understanding where team members seek to understand each other and stakeholders.**

This is the pillar that people often dismiss as "soft," but it's actually the foundation everything else is built on. Without empathy, excellence becomes punitive and empowerment becomes chaos.

Here's how I build empathetic teams:

**Create psychological safety.** People need to feel safe showing up authentically—sharing concerns, admitting when they don't know something, challenging ideas without fear of retribution. This doesn't mean there are no standards or accountability. It means people can be human while meeting those standards.

**Set a high bar for emotional intelligence.** This applies to everyone, including technical roles. Can someone recognize when a teammate is struggling? Do they understand how their communication lands with others? Can they navigate disagreement without making it personal? These aren't nice-to-haves—they're essential skills.

**Demand strong communication skills across all roles.** Engineers, designers, product managers, everyone needs to communicate clearly and considerately. Poor communication creates misunderstanding, which creates conflict, which destroys trust. Good communication isn't about being verbose—it's about being clear, considerate, and consistent.

## Putting It Together

These three pillars work together, not in isolation. Excellence without empathy becomes harsh and unsustainable. Empowerment without excellence leads to chaos. Empathy without empowerment feels patronizing.

The recipe is simple: hold a high standard for quality, give people real authority to do great work, and build an environment where they understand each other and feel understood.

But simple doesn't mean easy. It requires constant attention, difficult conversations, and the willingness to model the behavior you expect. It means hiring slowly and firing when necessary. It means building process that helps rather than hinders. It means caring about how people feel while still holding them accountable for results.

This is my foundation—the starting point for how I think about building and leading teams. Everything else is just details.
