I built two art cars. The first was called Sakana, or just the fish car and the most successful from an artistic perspective, and the second was called Jabba's barge and was the most successful from a fun perspective.

Sakana was built from an old Geo. Linen sails and bamboo that was grown in my father's backyard. We brought it out 2 years. A picture of it was featured on the cover of an art text book on american puppetering.

Jabba was a much more ambitious project. We modified it to be driven from the platform on top, and eventually added fire. It also had it's own sound system so we could host parties.
