				Hi, I’m Mike. I build websites, teams, and occasionally large strange
				objects that roll across deserts.
			</p>

			<p>
				For most of my career I’ve been a cross-functional team builder, helping
				designers, engineers, strategists, and stakeholders work together like a
				real unit. Those teams have delivered platforms for organizations like
				Yale, Stanford, NBC, and The Economist. My work lives mostly in open
				source land, especially Drupal, but I’m also fluent in WordPress and a
				handful of JavaScript frameworks. (This site is built with Astro.)
			</p>
			<p>
				When I’m not making the internet behave, I’m usually making something
				with my hands. My degree is in Fine Art Printmaking, and I still make
				prints now and then. I’ve built two Burning Man art cars (one ended up
				on the cover of an art history textbook, which is still a very funny
				sentence to say out loud). I’m a woodworker, a furniture builder, and a
				serial crafter who has absolutely dabbled in crochet and embroidery.
			</p>
			<p>
				This site is my archive: career work, ideas about building strong teams
				and better web practices, and a catalog of weird and wonderful things
				I’ve made over the years.
