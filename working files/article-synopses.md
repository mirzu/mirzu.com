## 1. The Smart Way to Price Your Website Project (And Why One Model Is Ideal)

**Published:** December 11, 2024

**One-sentence description:** A comparison of website project pricing models that makes the case for "fixed price with variable scope" as the ideal approach for large, complex web initiatives.

**Synopsis:** Website projects, much like home renovations, rarely go exactly as planned — and how you price them makes all the difference. This article breaks down three common pricing models: Time & Materials, Fixed Bid, and Fixed Price with Variable Scope, explaining why the third option offers the best balance of predictability and flexibility. The "fixed price with variable scope" model protects launch dates while allowing teams to incorporate new learnings at every project phase — from discovery through post-launch. The article walks through how understanding deepens at each stage (discovery, design, development, and launch), and why that's a feature, not a bug. If you're planning a website redesign and want to avoid budget overruns and missed deadlines, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/digital-strategy/smart-way-price-website-project/).

## 2. Build a Better Chatbot: How RAG Secures Better Results from AI

**cover image:** chatbots.png

**Published:** April 17, 2024

**One-sentence description:** An overview of how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves AI chatbot accuracy and a breakdown of the development stages for building a reliable chatbot.

**Synopsis:** AI chatbots hold enormous promise, but their tendency to "hallucinate" — generating plausible but incorrect answers — creates real risks for organizations. This article explains how RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) addresses that problem by grounding AI responses in verified source material, essentially giving the chatbot footnotes to cite. It also outlines Four Kitchens' proven development process for chatbot projects: starting with discovery to validate that AI is the right tool, moving through design and architecture, prompt engineering, two cycles of testing (internal and adversarial "red teaming"), and finally public deployment with ongoing monitoring. If you're considering an AI chatbot and want to understand the right way to build one, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/digital-strategy/build-better-chatbot-rag/).

## 3. Cover Letters Are Not Dumb: Why You Need to Write a Cover Letter for the Job You Want

**cover image:** cover-letter.jpg

**Published:** October 17, 2014

**One-sentence description:** A hiring manager's perspective on why cover letters are essential — and why skipping one can get your resume filed under "not qualified."

**Synopsis:** After spending a year evaluating job applicants, the author shares a hard truth: submitting a resume without a cover letter often means it won't even be reviewed. The cover letter serves multiple critical functions — it helps the hiring team understand how you interpret the role, it serves as a direct evaluation of your written communication skills (especially important for remote and distributed teams), and most importantly, it's the beginning of a relationship. Unlike a resume's chronological list of jobs and skills, a cover letter lets you convey personality, address potential weaknesses, and demonstrate genuine excitement for the position. If you've been skipping cover letters, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/article/cover-letters-are-not-dumb-why-you-need-write-cover-letter-job-you-want/) to understand what you're leaving on the table.

## 4. A Better Way to Theme Field Collections

**cover image:** fieldcollections.jpg

**Published:** June 3, 2013

**One-sentence description:** A clean, maintainable approach to theming Drupal 7 field collections using a custom helper function and the entity metadata wrapper.

**Synopsis:** Field collections in Drupal 7 are powerful but notoriously frustrating to theme, with most online documentation pointing to solutions that feel hacky at best. This article presents a cleaner method: a reusable function that extracts themed items from a field collection into a simple rows array, making the templating feel more natural — similar to working with Views row templates. The approach leverages Drupal's entity_metadata_wrapper for clean code, and the resulting field templates are easy to read and maintain. If you're working with Drupal 7 field collections and want a better theming pattern, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/article/better-way-theme-field-collections/).

## 5. Speed and Quality? Yes, You Can Have Both

**cover image:** agile-qa.jpg

**Published:** May 7, 2020

**One-sentence description:** How Four Kitchens integrates quality assurance into its Agile workflow from Day 1 so that speed and quality reinforce each other rather than compete.

**Synopsis:** The common assumption is that solid QA testing slows down Agile development, but this article argues that's only true when QA is treated as a separate phase rather than an embedded practice. At Four Kitchens, QA starts on Day 1 — with clearly defined features, a shared "definition of done," and prioritized goals. Every line of code is reviewed by a peer developer on the same project team (not a separate QA group), which creates accountability and catches issues early. The process is layered with automated linting, strategic automated testing, periodic specialist audits, and a customized launch checklist. The philosophy is prevention over debugging: don't build things and then make them right — build them right from the start. If you want to understand how to achieve both speed and quality in your development process, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/development/proven-digital-quality-assurance-processes/).

## 6. Hiring and Onboarding: The 48 Hour Rule

**cover image:** 48-hour-rule.jpg

**Published:** March 3, 2016

**One-sentence description:** A practical onboarding strategy that requires new team members to deliver something productive within their first 48 hours on the job.

**Synopsis:** The 48-hour rule is simple: every new hire must complete a real, productive task within two days of joining. For a developer, that's a pull request; for a designer, a design artifact; for a marketer, their first tweet. This aggressive but intentional timeline solves four major onboarding challenges — it creates immediate inclusion by turning an outsider into a contributing team member, it surfaces gaps in the onboarding process, it forces the existing team to give focused attention to the new person, and it reveals potential red flags early. The key is selecting the right task (real work, done collaboratively) and providing meaningful feedback on the output. If you're looking to improve how your team brings on new people, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/article/hiring-and-onboarding-48-hour-rule).

## 7. Follow These Steps to Get Decoupling's Website Performance Gains Without the Costs

**cover image:** headless-benefits.jpg

**Published:** September 10, 2021

**One-sentence description:** A practical guide to achieving the performance and flexibility benefits of a decoupled architecture while keeping your traditional CMS intact.

**Synopsis:** Decoupling your website's frontend from its backend promises speed, scalability, and development flexibility — but it also demands more developer resources, increases hosting complexity, and limits what site editors can do. This article argues that for most organizations, component-driven development tools like Emulsify and Storybook can deliver many of the same benefits without the full cost of decoupling. Proper caching, CDN optimization, and lean CSS/JavaScript practices can match decoupled performance gains, while progressive decoupling lets you incrementally adopt API-driven architecture only where you actually need it. If you're weighing whether to decouple your CMS and want a more nuanced view of your options, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/digital-strategy/decoupling-benefits-traditional-cms/).

## 8. Reusable Development Environments on a VM Part 1: Setting Up the DNS to Work Properly on Mac OSX

**cover image:** osx-dns.jpg

**Published:** August 29, 2012

**One-sentence description:** A step-by-step guide to configuring a local DNS server on Mac OSX so that virtual machine development environments automatically resolve wildcard domains.

**Synopsis:** When running local development on a virtual machine, adding a new site means manually editing your /etc/hosts file every time — because Mac OSX doesn't support wildcard entries like `*.local`. This tutorial walks through setting up a BIND DNS server on your Mac to solve that problem, so that any new subdirectory you create on your VM automatically becomes a resolvable local domain. The guide covers editing named.conf, creating zone files, generating the required keys, starting the daemon, and verifying everything works with dig and ping. If you're tired of manually managing hosts entries for local development, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/article/reusable-development-enviroments-vm-part-1-setting-dns-work-properly-mac-osx/).

## 9. VR DrupalCon Demo Case Study

**cover image:** VR-Demo.jpg

**Published:** June 1, 2017

**One-sentence description:** A behind-the-scenes look at how Four Kitchens built a WebVR experience for DrupalCon Baltimore that let attendees virtually visit team members' home offices.

**Synopsis:** As a fully remote company, Four Kitchens' team members only see each other's workspaces through webcam windows — so they built a WebVR experience that let people actually explore those spaces. Using A-Frame (a framework that makes creating VR scenes almost as simple as editing HTML), along with React, Webpack, and 360° photography, the team put together an immersive demo in just a few weeks. The biggest challenge wasn't the technology — it was storytelling in a medium where the viewer can look in every direction, requiring the team to think beyond traditional one-directional visual narrative. The demo was a hit at DrupalCon, and the team continued developing tools to make WebVR content creation accessible through Drupal. If you're curious about the intersection of WebVR and content management, [read the full article](https://www.fourkitchens.com/blog/office-news/vr-drupalcon-demo-case-study/).
